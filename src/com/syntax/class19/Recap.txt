Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to  control the visibility of class members
and classes itself in Java.
There are four access levels and there are three keywords that we use
to define these access levels. Fourth level is applier when we don't
use any access modifier keywords.

Levels from the most restricted to less restricted are:
1) private (visible inside class only)
2) default (visible inside package only)
3) protected (visible inside class, package, subclass(Same package)
and subclass(different package)
4) public (visible anywhere)
*note, the difference between public and protected is that public
can be accessed from outside class but protected cannot be accessed
from outside class.

Rules:
1)we should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data
and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform
checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might
misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access
the data.
2) we can't use access modifiers with local variables.

Constructors:
Constructors in java  allows us to set the values of the fields of a
class.
